This script opens up a GUI which streamlines using certain applications I would constantly use my computer for.
It would be worth going through and costuming the API for your specific needs.

It displays the local time and hosts a selection of uses.
"htop" opens task and resource allocation on computer.
"Uni Project" opens specific tasks I needed during my MSc.
"Admin" opened tasks specific to me.
"Indie Project" opens a smooth way of navigating Yahoo Japan for a selection of clothing brands and a selection of criteria.
"Recreational" simply opened tools I frequently used.
"Update" would update the GUI incase someone was actively tailoring it to their needs.
"Terminal" opens a terminal file!
